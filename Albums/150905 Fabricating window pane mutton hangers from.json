      "description": "The window panes (muttons) in our front door occasionally fall out.  Sometimes they break and I have to glue them.  They are held in by little metal clips, but they get bent and require readjustment.  After many years of misuse by window cleaners and adjustment, the metal fatigued and the first one has failed.  I can\u0027t find them online, so what can I do... I have to make a replacement!",
