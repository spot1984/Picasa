      "description": "Time to cut the threaded rod.  \nI have some tips for those of you who have not doe this before:\n\n1. ALWAYS WEAR EYE PROTECTION AND BE VERY CAREFUL.  Small slivers of metal can be very damaging especially to your eyes.  If you work around metalwork be sure to tell people at the hospital because an MRI can cause more damage.\n2. When marking where the cut should be, roll the rod until the mark falls exactly into a valley, it will be the easiest place to start the cut.\n3. Thread nuts onto the threaded rod on either side of the cut.  These will help guide the saw, and even better, they will dress the threads as you unscrew them over the cut end.\n4. Do not hold the threads in the vise, the steel jaws will flatten and destroy them.  Either grab them between pieces of wood or grab the nut as seen here.\n5. Support the ends of the rod so it does not bend.  This piece has nearly 4 feet extending off to the left, if unsupported the rod would probably have bent making it unsuitable especially for this application.",

The easiest way to do this is to bring both carriages all the way towards the near pillow blocks.\nStart by lining up the slots on both pulleys to be straight up and place the connector in a slot on one pulley while winding the chain onto the other pulley.  Crank the chain around and see if the connector falls into a slot on the second pulley.  If it does not, remove the chain and try again, this time with the second pulley either advanced or retarded one ball as needed.",
