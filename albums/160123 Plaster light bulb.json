I did manage to grind some glass off, but I think I was more efficient at removing the abrasive from the paper.  I gave up and broke out the diamond bits for the Dremmel which cut through the glass with ease.(Wear eye protection and don\u0027t breathe glass dust if you like to breathe)",

I ended up using a small thin straw through the hole to let air in to relieve the vacuum pressure to let the water out.",
