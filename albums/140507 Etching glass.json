      "description": "Unfortunately it did not turn out perfectly.  I was rushing and this was the first etching I ever did.  I did not thoroughly clean and dry the glass first, I did not use fresh vinyl, but rather the outer shell of an old roll that had seen some wear and whose adhesive may have blistered and lost some stick, and I did not properly, thoroughly burnish the mask.  Some combination of these factors led to the etchant getting under the mask in the upper corner of the last \"t\".  Lesson learned.",

But, it is legible and it was fun  :-)",
