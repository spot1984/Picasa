      "description": "I broke the glasses* I use in the shop, so I decided to fix them.\nHere I\u0027m clamping them and using acrylic cement to try to fuse the frames back together.  I used the drywall screw in the hemostats as an applicator to get the adhesive solution to wick into the gap by capillary action which worked well.  But the adhesive did not hold.\n\n\n*Costco reading glasses, not prescription, they are a few bucks apiece tops, I\u0027m not sure what compels me to put such energy into these projects.",
